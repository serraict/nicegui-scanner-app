## Create PyPi Package

**Goal**: Make the barcode scanner available as an installable Python package so users can easily add it to their NiceGUI projects.

**Current State**:

- Scanner works well as a local component
- Code is organized in `src/nicegui_scanner/` directory
- Has Vue component, Python element, and example app
- Missing package configuration and distribution setup

**Tasks**:

1. **Package Structure Setup** âœ… COMPLETED
   - âœ… Create proper `pyproject.toml` with package metadata
   - âœ… Ensure `src/nicegui_scanner/` structure is pip-installable
   - âœ… Add `__init__.py` exports for clean API

2. **Create Distribution Build** âœ… COMPLETED
   - âœ… Add Makefile with build, package, and publish commands
   - âœ… Add github action for ci build and for publish on release
   - âœ… Use dynamic versioning with uv
   - âœ… Test local installation with `uv pip install -e .`
   - âœ… Example app placed outside src dir and references editable package
   - âœ… Verify package works (tested with examples/app.py)

3. **API Design & Testing** âœ… COMPLETED  
   - âœ… Design clean import API: `from nicegui_scanner import BarcodeScanner`
   - âœ… Test in example app using installed package
   - âœ… Test in NiceGUI `page` context (not just `ui.run()`)

**Success Criteria**:

- âœ… `uv pip install -e .` installs the package (editable mode tested)
- âœ… `from nicegui_scanner import BarcodeScanner` works
- âœ… Scanner component works in both app and page contexts (both tested)
- âœ… Makefile automates build and publish process
- âœ… Dynamic versioning works (v0.1.0 tag â†’ nicegui_scanner-0.1.0 package)
- âœ… Package builds successfully (`make build` creates wheel and source dist)
- âœ… The package is uploaded to PyPi in the publish step (GitHub Actions configured)
- âœ… Github actions builds package for every push to main (CI succeeded)
- âœ… Github actions build package and pushes to PyPi for all version tags (SUCCESS v0.1.2)
- manual testing:
  - start a new project
  - then follow readme documentation
  - pip install nicegui, pip install nicegui-scanner,
  - and see that the app is running and scanning qr codes

**Completed Implementation**:

- âœ… GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` & `release.yml`)
- âœ… Testing in NiceGUI `page` context (`examples/page_example.py`)

**Final Result**: ðŸŽ‰ âœ… COMPLETE - PyPI Package Successfully Published!

**Published Package**: `nicegui-scanner v0.1.2` available at <https://pypi.org/project/nicegui-scanner/>

**Working CI/CD Pipeline**:

- âœ… Automated CI testing on every main branch push  
- âœ… Automated PyPI publishing on version tag pushes
- âœ… Dynamic versioning working correctly
- âœ… Trusted publishing configured and functional
